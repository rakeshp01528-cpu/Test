audio_converter_pro.py

A delivery-ready audio conversion pipeline:
  1. Load any audio format (via soundfile, falling back to pydub/ffmpeg for
     exotic formats soundfile can't read directly, e.g. mp3 on some builds).
  2. Measure integrated loudness per ITU-R BS.1770 (the standard behind
     LUFS, used by Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, EBU R128 broadcast, etc.)
     using a pure-NumPy implementation (bs1770_pure.py) -- no scipy
     dependency, so it won't hit scipy's compiled-extension issues (e.g.
     Windows Application Control / WDAC / Smart App Control blocking one
     of scipy's DLLs, which is a common source of ImportError on locked-
     down machines).
  3. Apply gain to hit a target LUFS value.
  4. True-peak-safe limit so the loudness-normalized signal can't clip,
     including inter-sample peaks that appear after lossy encoding.
  5. Export to the target format at an explicit, pinned bitrate.

Requires: pip install soundfile pydub numpy --break-system-packages
Also requires ffmpeg on PATH (pydub shells out to it for format conversion),
and bs1770_pure.py alongside this file.
